# AI Chat Application

## Overview

ChatBot-AI implements a user-friendly application where users can interact with an AI model in a chat interface. The application allows users to provide feedback at each stage of the conversation, including immediate reactions to AI responses and an overall rating at the end of each chat.Designed with usability in mind, the interface provides a seamless experience for chatting, rating, and reviewing feedback.

## Features
1. **Real-time Feedback on Responses:**<br>
 - Users can like or dislike each AI response using thumbs up/thumbs down buttons.<br>
 - These buttons are hidden until the user hovers over the AIâ€™s response, making the interface clean and engaging.

2. **End-of-Conversation Feedback**:<br>
 - After completing a conversation, users can provide an overall rating, selecting from a 5-point Likert scale or 5-star rating.<br>
 - Users can also leave additional subjective feedback to capture more nuanced opinions.

3. **Conversation Management**:<br>
 - Users can engage in multiple conversations, each saved and accessible from a side/top bar panel.<br>
 - Conversations can be revisited, showing both the chat history and associated feedback.<br>

4. **Comprehensive Feedback Overview**:<br>
 - A dedicated view allows users to see feedback across all conversations.<br>
 - Feedback can be filtered and sorted by rating, providing an easy-to-navigate summary.

5. **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: 
 - Users can switch between light and dark themes for improved readability and comfort.
